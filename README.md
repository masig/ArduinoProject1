# ArduinoProjectUno
As first timers in the Arduino coding world, the "OG Squad" will remake the code for our new wing rooms' projector.
As we become more familiar with the language of C, we will move on to attack larger and more complicated projects, such as identify the temperature of a classroom and display it on a four digital tube. When complete, we will proceed by detecting and displaying of humidity in a classroom, either on the same or a different four digital tube as the latter.
